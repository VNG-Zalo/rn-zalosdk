- When unit testing, we are checking the smallest unit in our codebase to find out how happy, unhappy and edge cases work for that piece of unit
- For example, a unit could be individual methods and functions in classes or really any small pieces of functionality. We mock out dependencies in these tests so that we can test individual methods and functions in isolation.
